# BLOSSOM - BioLOgical Simulation in SOil Model
A soil biota agent based model (ABM) based on [Repast4Py](https://repast.github.io/repast4py.site/index.html)

## C++ Instructions
The `./blossom_cpp` folder contains the model itself, and the config file needed to run the model. The filestructure should look as follosw:

```
📁 **blossom_cpp/**
├── 📁 **bin/** (cpp bin folder)
├── 📁 **build/** (cpp build folder)
├── 📁 **configs/** (config files will be generated by BLOSSOM in here)
├── 📁 **include/** (contains .hpp files)
├── 📁 **outputs/**
│   ├── 📁 **agents/** (will contain agent logs)
│   └── 📁 **som/** (will contain som logs)
└── 📁 **src/** (contains .cpp files)
```

In the `base_config.props` file, most of the parameters can be set. One parameter can be set in `src/main.cpp`: `const int num_trials` where the value determines the number of trials of the base_config, using different random seeds and different `N0` values for each trial.

### Install/Run
Prerequisites: 
- C++ compiler that supports C++ 20 (GCC >= 11, Clang >= 15)
- make

1. Run `make` in `./blossom_cpp` (make sure to set `const int num_trials` first, since this will be compiled into the executable! So everytime you change this value, first run make again, then blossom)
2. Run `./bin/blossom` and BLOSSOM will start to run the simulations!

## Python Instructions

The `./blossom` folder contains the model itself, notebook to create trophic networks, input files, and output files. The `./blossom_viz` folder contains notebooks for model run visualizations. The `./experiments` folder contains notebooks for analysis. The `./figures` folder contains notebooks used to create the thesis figures, including result and discussion visualizations.

### Install/Run instructions
Tested for Windows with [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) Ubuntu 22.04, and Python 3.10.7. 

1. Install MPI (in this case [mpich](https://www.mpich.org/), but openMPI should also work fine (not tested)): `sudo apt install mpich`
2. Install Python libraries to run the BLOSSOM model (consider making a venv) `env CC=mpicxx pip3 install repast4py scikit-learn`
     - If you encounter issues with Repast4Py, try following the [Repast4Py install instructions](https://repast.github.io/repast4py.site/index.html)
3. Install Python libraries to run the Jupyter Notebooks (consider making a venv) `pip3 install jupyter pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels`
4. Run the model from the `./blossom` folder with the command `mpirun -n 4 python3 blossom_2d.py ./inputs/run_2d.yaml`, where `-n <#_processes>` sets the number of processes that are used. NOTE: `-n 1` is not supported!
