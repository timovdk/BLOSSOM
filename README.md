# BLOSSOM - BioLOgical Simulation in SOil Model
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/711296558.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15644093)

A soil biota agent based model (ABM) to simulate organisms in a 2d space.

## Instructions
The `./blossom` folder contains the model itself, and the config file needed to run the model. The filestructure should look as follows:

⚠️ You probably have to create some of these folders before running BLOSSOM ⚠️

```
📁 **blossom/**
├── 📁 bin
├── 📁 build
├── 📁 configs (config files will be generated by BLOSSOM in here)
├── 📁 hpc (contains scripts for running on a slurm capable hpc)
├── 📁 include (contains .hpp files)
├── 📁 outputs
│   ├── 📁 agents (will contain agent logs)
│   └── 📁 som (will contain som logs)
└── 📁 src (contains .cpp files)
```

In the `base_config.props` file, most of the parameters can be set. One parameter can be set in `src/main.cpp`: `const int num_trials` where the value determines the number of trials of the base_config, using different random seeds and different `N0` values for each trial.

### Install/Run
Prerequisites: 
- C++ compiler that supports C++ 20 (GCC >= 11, Clang >= 15)
- make

1. Run `make` in `./blossom` (make sure to set `const int num_trials` first, since this will be compiled into the executable! So everytime you change this value, first run make again, then blossom)
2. Run `./bin/blossom` and BLOSSOM will start to run the simulations!
